# The Ocean Cleanup - Visual Survey App

*The Ocean Cleanup develops technologies against plastic pollution.*

## Introduction

Welcome to the app repository for The Ocean Cleanup Visual Surveys. The Ocean Cleanup uses visual surveys to improve the current estimate of the total mass of ocean plastic floating at the world’s ocean. The app is developed in order to support the research and expeditions to determine the dimension and amounts of ocean plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – an accumulation zone for debris forming between Hawaii and California.

## App

In order to support the research, this app, based on Appcelerator Titanium, will allow users to report sightings of pollution. Currently the app is under development, the initial release is planned for May.

The first release will be primarily for the Ocean Cleanup's own expeditions starting summer 2015. In the future, everyone who wants to help contribute data will be able to.

## Getting Started

### Quick start

In order to build the project clone the project and read how to get started with Titanium on [http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/guide/Quick_Start](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/guide/Quick_Start).

### Documentation

The Visual Survey app uses JSDuck for documentation. In order to generate the documentation install JSDuck on your machine. Generated documentation is located in the /docs/ directory. Simply open the index.html page and enjoy.

## Helping out

Want to help out? Great! Feel free to test the app, post issues/suggestions/improvements or clone the project to code them yourself.
